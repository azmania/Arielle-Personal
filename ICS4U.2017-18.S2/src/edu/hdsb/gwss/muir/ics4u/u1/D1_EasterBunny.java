 * The date of Easter Sunday can vary widely from year to year. The Council of 
 * Nicaea in A.D. 325 decreed that Easter Sunday was to be held on the first Sunday 
 * following the full moon that occurred on or after the first day of spring. 
 * Because the date depends on solar, lunar, and calendar cycles, it is not easy 
 * to find an arithmetic procedure that will determine the correct date for any 
 * given year.
 * 
 * The first such procedure was determined in 1876; an adaptation of
 * that procedure is given below. It involves a sequence of divisions that start
 * with the year, and eventually produce a month number (3 for March, 4 for April) 
 * and the day of the month.
